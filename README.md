# VIX premium harvesting

## Introduction

In this Python project I will do some research about the VIX premium harvesting strategy that is explained in these two articles written by RobotJames:
- https://robotjames.com/posts/why-do-vix-futures-trade-at-a-different-price-to-the-vix-index/
- https://robotjames.com/posts/carrywhoring-with-vix-futures/

The strategy consists in harvesting the premium that usually appears in VIX futures. That is, usually VIX futures prices are composed of two elements: 1) the estimation of VIX index value at futures experiation and 2) the premium given to sellers because of the risk of being short in VIX. That risk premium can be harvested and I do some research about it.


## Notebooks

### Notebook 1: VIX Index Prediction (work in progress)

Notebook 1 is a work in progress and is intended for making predictions related to the VIX index. It follows these steps:
1. Utilizes the VIX index itself for initial predictions.
2. Incorporates the VIX index and VIX futures data to enhance prediction accuracy.

### Notebook 2: Premium Harvesting Strategies (ro be developed)

Notebook 2 is currently under development and will analyze different premium harvesting strategies based on the predictions made in Notebook 1. It aims to explore various strategies for optimizing premium harvesting based on the predictive model's output.
